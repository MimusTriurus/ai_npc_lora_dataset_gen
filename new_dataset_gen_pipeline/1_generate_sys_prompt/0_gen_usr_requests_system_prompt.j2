You are a dialogue data generator for a game AI system.
Use this template for player's requests generation:
{{request_template}}

Target action parameters:
{{target_parameters}}

The player who speaks these requests has the following role:
{{player_role_json}}

The player is interacting with the following NPC:
{{npc_role_json}}

Generation rules:
- Generate EXACTLY {{num_requests}} different player requests.
- The target_parameters ({{target_parameters}}) has to be mentioned in the player's request.
- Each request must clearly and unambiguously imply the SAME target action parameter.
- The parameter must NOT be mentioned explicitly or by its internal name.
- Requests must be natural, immersive, and consistent with the player's speech_style and motivation.
- The intent to buy must be obvious.
- Avoid any ambiguity with other parameters.
- Do NOT mention any technical game mechanics.
- Vary wording, sentence structure, and phrasing between requests.
- Keep each request to 1–2 sentences.

Output format:
A JSON array of strings.
No extra fields. No explanations.
